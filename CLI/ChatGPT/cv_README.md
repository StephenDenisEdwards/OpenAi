# 📄 Interactive CV Query System using LangChain & FAISS

This project allows **interactive querying** of a CV document using **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and **FAISS**. Users can ask natural language questions about the CV, and the system retrieves relevant information using **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Load and process a CV document** into a structured format.
- **Store information in a FAISS vector database** for efficient retrieval.
- **Enable interactive querying** using OpenAI’s GPT model.
- **Maintain conversation context** for follow-up questions.
- **Secure FAISS deserialization** with controlled loading.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install langchain openai faiss-cpu tiktoken unstructured
```

## 📂 Project Structure

```

## ⚙️ Usage

### 2️⃣ Load & Process the CV

Run the **CV processing script** to:

* Load the CV document.
* Split it into smaller chunks.
* Generate embeddings and store them in  **FAISS** .

```bash
python process_cv.py
```

This will create a FAISS index stored in `cv_faiss_index/`.

### 3️⃣ Run Interactive Query System

Once the FAISS vector store is created, launch the chatbot:

```bash
python interactive_query.py
```

You can now ask **any question** about the CV in natural language.

### **FAISS Vector Database: A Simple Explanation**

**FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** is an **open-source** library developed by **Meta (Facebook AI Research)** for  **efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors** . It is commonly used in **AI, NLP, and search applications** to quickly find the most relevant results from large datasets.

---

## **🔹 What is a Vector Database?**

A **vector database** is a system that stores **high-dimensional numerical representations** (vectors) of data and allows **fast searching** based on similarity. Instead of matching exact keywords (like traditional databases), vector databases find **similar meanings** using mathematical distances.

FAISS is a **vector database** specialized in searching through  **millions or even billions of vectors efficiently** .

---

## **🔹 How Does FAISS Work?**

1. **Convert text into numerical embeddings (vectors)**
   * Text, images, or any structured/unstructured data are converted into **high-dimensional vectors** using machine learning models (e.g., OpenAI Embeddings, BERT).
2. **Store the vectors in FAISS**
   * The vectors are indexed in a FAISS database, allowing for fast similarity searches.
3. **Perform fast nearest neighbor search**
   * When a user queries a vector, FAISS finds **the most similar vectors** using algorithms like:
     * **Flat Index (Brute Force Search)**
     * **IVF (Inverted File Index)**
     * **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs)**

---

## **🔹 Why Use FAISS?**

✅ **Scalable** – Handles millions of vectors efficiently.

✅ **Fast** – Finds nearest neighbors in sub-millisecond time.

✅ **Memory-efficient** – Optimized indexing structures reduce RAM usage.

✅ **Supports Various Search Methods** – Brute-force search, clustering, and quantization.

✅ **Works Well with AI** – Used in  **chatbots, recommendation systems, and NLP applications** .

| **Use Case**    | AI search, chatbots, NLP, recommendation systems | Structured data, transactions          |

---

## **🔹 Example: How FAISS Works in a CV Query System**

1. **Convert CV text into vectors** using OpenAI Embeddings.
2. **Store those vectors in FAISS** for retrieval.
3. **When a user asks a question** , convert the question into a vector and search for the most relevant CV section.
4. **Return the most relevant answer** based on similarity.

---

## **🔹 FAISS Code Example**

```python
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

# Create FAISS Index from text documents
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vector_store = FAISS.from_documents(documents, embeddings)

# Save FAISS Index
vector_store.save_local("faiss_index")

# Load FAISS Index for querying
vector_store = FAISS.load_local("faiss_index", embeddings)

# Perform a similarity search
query = "What is the latest job in the CV?"
results = vector_store.similarity_search(query)

print(results[0].page_content)  # Returns the most relevant CV section
```

---

## **🔹 When Should You Use FAISS?**

🔹 **Searching through large text datasets quickly**

🔹 **Finding similar documents or articles**

🔹 **Building AI-powered Q&A systems (like our CV chatbot!)**

🔹 **Recommendation systems** (e.g., "People who liked this also liked...")

🔹 **Image similarity search** (finding similar images)

### **Why Do You Need to Connect to an LLM (like GPT-4o) to Query the CV?**

FAISS **alone** is just a  **vector database** . It **stores** and **retrieves** similar text  **but does not generate responses intelligently** . That’s where  **GPT-4o (or any other LLM) comes in** .

---

## **🔹 What FAISS Can Do vs. What GPT-4o Can Do**

| Feature                                                   | FAISS (Vector Database) | GPT-4o (LLM) |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| **Stores CV information**                           | ✅ Yes                  | ❌ No        |
| **Finds relevant sections**                         | ✅ Yes                  | ✅ Yes       |
| **Understands complex queries**                     | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes       |
| **Parses multiple sections into a coherent answer** | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes       |
| **Rewrites or summarizes text**                     | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes       |
| **Handles multi-turn conversations**                | ❌ No                   | ✅ Yes       |

---

## **🔹 How They Work Together**

1. **FAISS:** Finds the **most relevant text snippets** from the CV.
2. **GPT-4o:** Uses those snippets to  **understand, summarize, and generate human-like responses** .

---

## **🔹 Example Without GPT-4o (FAISS Only)**

Imagine you ask:

> *"What was Stephen's most recent job?"*

**FAISS will return the raw CV text:**

```
"Senior Software Architect and Engineer at Zeiss, Munich, Germany (Jan 2023 – Dec 2024)"
```

It does **not** format it properly, provide context, or answer follow-up questions.

---

## **🔹 Example With GPT-4o**

You ask:

> *"What was Stephen's most recent job?"*

**FAISS retrieves relevant CV sections, and GPT-4o processes them into a response:**

```
"Stephen Edwards most recently worked as a Senior Software Architect and Engineer at Zeiss in Munich, Germany, from January 2023 to December 2024. He focused on developing the CORI platform for remote medical device management."
```

This is  **much more readable and useful** .

---

## **🔹 What Happens When You Ask a Complex Query?**

### **Example Query:**

> *"Has Stephen worked with AI or Machine Learning?"*

### **FAISS Only:**

* FAISS finds relevant text snippets (e.g., "Used TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV for CNN image processing").
* **BUT it does not explain or connect these snippets** .

### **FAISS + GPT-4o:**

* FAISS retrieves snippets.
* GPT-4o **understands the context** and answers:
  ```
  "Yes, Stephen has experience in AI and machine learning. He worked with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV for deep learning models, specifically in image processing tasks."
  ```

---

## **🔹 Why This Matters for Your CV Query System**

✅ **Makes FAISS outputs readable and conversational**

✅ **Summarizes long job descriptions into clear answers**

✅ **Understands follow-up questions (context-aware chat)**

✅ **Allows users to ask in natural language, not rigid search queries**

---

## **🔹 Final Answer: Why Connect GPT-4o?**

🔹 **FAISS retrieves relevant text, but it can’t "think" or "talk."**

🔹 **GPT-4o turns raw data into human-like answers.**

🔹 **Combining them makes querying the CV seamless and intelligent.**
